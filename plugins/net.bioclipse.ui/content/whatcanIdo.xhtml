<h1>What can I do with Bioclipse2?</h1>
<br/><br/>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Bioclipse 2.0 mainly consists of chemoinformatics features. Due to the
data model re-engineering in Bioclipse 2, the Bioclipse 1.x bioinformatics
features are yet to be incorporated. They will be available again in a later
version.
</p>

<h3>1.1 Bioclipse Explorer</h3>
<p>Bioclipse does not work directly on the file system but utilizes a workspace,
a directory in the filesystem that contains a special .metadata subdirectory. 
The .metadata directory contains all the workspace's private information, such as 
settings, caches, etc. The workspace organizes top-level projects, folders, and files 
in a hierarchical structure.
</p>
<p>
Bioclipse Explorer, also known as the Bioclipse Navigator (or simply Navigator)
is the central view for manipulating resources (e.g. Files). It supports common
features, such as drag-and-drop, cut-and-paste, rename, delete etc. 
</p>

<p>
There is always one project called <i>Virtual</i>. Any files copied here are
kept only in memory and will not survive a restart of Bioclipse.

<h3>1.2 Import data into Bioclipse</h3>
<p>To add files to Bioclipse you need at least one top level Project in Bioclipse. 
In the top menu, select <b>File &gt; New &gt; Project...</b> to open the New Project
Wizard. Choose <b>Project</b> and enter a name for the project, then Finish. Now
you can drag and drop or copy/cut and paste files from your computer into this project.
</p>

<p>
Another way to import data into a project is via the <b>Import...</b> action.
Open the menu <b>File &gt; Import...</b> wizard and select <b>File System</b>.
Here you can browse and check any files that you'd like to import into Bioclipse.
</p>

<p>
The simplest way to get data into Bioclipse is to install the Sample Data Project. 
This needs to be downloaded and installed from Bioclipse Update Site (see section 1.3 below).

After installing the feature and restarting Bioclipse, select menu 
<b>File &gt; New &gt; Project...</b> to open the New Project Wizard. 
Choose <b>Sample Data Project</b> and enter a name for the project, click "Next" and 
choose what you'd like to install. Click "Finish".

<h3>1.3 Install new features</h3>
<p>
Choose menu <b>Help &gt; Search for new features...</b>. Bioclipse will contact the 
update site and display features that you can download and install. If you are located behind 
a proxy server, you can set proxy settings in the Preferences, section Networks (see section 1.5 below). 
It is possible to add additional update sites in the Preferences under section <i>Update Sites</i>.

<h3>1.4 Show views</h3>
<p>
Bioclipse comes bundled with several Views (separate windows in the workbench) of use within 
chemoinformatics. Use the menu <b>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other...</b> and select any view to open. 
For example, you can add the 2DStructure view, that displays any selected molecules in 2D.

<h3>1.5 Customize Bioclipse</h3>
<p>
You can easily customize Bioclispe in many ways. For example, dragging views and 
editors to resize/reposition them. Bioclipse stores this information between sessions. 
Preferences are available from the menu option Preferences, under menu Window on Linux and Windows, 
and under Bioclipse on Mac OS X.

<h3>2.1 Viewing/Editing chemical structures in 2D</h3>
<p>
If you double-click a file with 2D coordinates (currently only CML and MDL/MOL file formats are suported), 
the 2D editor (called JChemPaint or simply JCP) opens up, allowing for editing 
of the chemical structure. When done you can save the file (<i>Save as..</i> is not implemented yet). 
The outline view gives a hierarchical view of the molecule, enumerating atoms/bonds. 
Click in the outline view to highlight in the JCP editor.

<h3>2.2 Working with SDFiles</h3>
<p>
If you double-click an SDFile (with file extension .sdf), the SDFEditor opens up. 
Here you can see the molecules in tabular format, but you can easily switch to 
displaying/editing individual molecules by clicking the <i>Source</i> tab at the bottom of the editor. 
Also, use the outline to easily navigate the file. You can also edit the properties 
of individual entries in the SDFile by just clicking on them in the Table tab. 
Select one or more molecules and right-click, choose <i>Extract...</i> to save the 
selected molecules to file.
</p>

<p>If you open the 2DStructure and/or the Jmol View, they show the currently selected molecule in 3D or 3D. 
For example, if you open an SDFile with 3D structures, clicking on one row in the 
SDFileEditor displays this molecule in 3D in the JmolView, and in 2D in the 2DView.

<h3>2.3 Visualizing chemical structures in 3D</h3>
<p>
If you double-click a file with 3D coordinates (currently only PDB, MDL/MOL, and CML files are supported), 
the JmolEditor will open. Click and drag to rotate. Holding down shift, click and drag to zoom. 
Use the Jmol menu to manipulate the presentation. The outline view can be used to 
highlight parts of biopolymers (such as proteins).

<h3>3.1 The Console</h3>
<p>
Bioclipse is equipped with a Javascript console for issuing Javascript commands to Bioclipse. 
If not open, find it under menu <b>Window &gt; Show views &gt; other...</b>. In the console, click 
the <i>Tab</i> key to show the available functions and namespaces. 
Type, for example, <i>help cdk</i> to see the available commands within the cdk namespace.
There are sample Javascripts in the SampleData Project, and also see the Bioclipse Wiki for 
more information regarding the scripting language.

highlighting. In the toolbar, there is a "play" button to run the script.
