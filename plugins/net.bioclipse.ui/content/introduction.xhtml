<h1>Welcome to Bioclipse</h1>

<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<img src="images/jcp_full.png" align="right" width="600" />
<p>
Bioclipse is an open source workbench for life science. This means, you can use 
it to import/export/edit/visualize/convert etc entities in chemistry (chemoinformatics), 
biology and biotechnology (bioinformatics), medicine and pharmacology (medical informatics) 
and other related fields in life science that requires computational assistance.

</p>

<p>
Bioclipse has an extensible plugin architecture and it is very easy to extend it with 
functionality into virtually any direction. The Bioclispe 2.0 release is targeted 
towards chemoinformatics, and is not to be considered stable. The core builds on 
a scriptable framework, and most functionality can be automated using Javascripts.
</p>

<p>
Bioclipse is the ideal framework and platform to develop and deliver software in 
life science to end users. Written in Java, the platform itself also supports 
extensions with external programs and code written in other languages.</p>

<h3>License</h3>
<p>
Bioclipse is made up of plugins, whose code uses a number of different licenses. 
The Bioclipse platform, consisting of the core plugins, is licensed as EPL.
