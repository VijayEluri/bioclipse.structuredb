			The Bioclipse Navigator (also known as the Bioclipse Explorer) 
			is the central view in Bioclipse for working woth resources, such as files. 
			By default it is located to the left in the workbench and points to a 
			a special folder on the computer called the "Workspace", which is a 
			special folder on your computer where all the data in Bioclipse is stored and accessed.

			Everything listed in the Navigator is a Resource, and the top level 
			Resources are called Projects which can contain folders and/or files. 
			All files and folders need to be located in a Project. 
			You can easily create new Projects, Folders, and Files by right-clicking 
			in the Bioclipse Navigator.
			
			Now, create a new General Project from the File< menu. 
			Name the project "My Test Project".
