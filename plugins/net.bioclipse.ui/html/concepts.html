<h1>Bioclipse concepts</h1>

<p>
<h3>Views</h3>
In Bioclipse, a View is a window that provides some graphical interface to present 
something for a user, and might let him interact with it. Examples are the BioResource 
Navigator, the Jmol View and the properties view.
See a more detailed introduction to <a href="workbench/wb_views.html">Workbench Views</a> here.

<p>
<h3><a name="editors">Editors</a></h3>
An Editor is focused on letting the user edit an underlying model and 
 follows the load-save cycle. An example is a simple editor for text-files, 
 but could also be more advanced such as a graphical objects editor like 
 the JchemPaint editor. 
 See a more detailed introduction to <a href="workbench/wb_editors.html">Editors</a> here.

<p>
<h3><a name="perspectives">Perspectives</a></h3>
Perspectives are collections of editors and views that are grouped 
into a page on screen, e.g. the Chemoinformatics perspective in Bioclipse 
displays views and editors for working with molecules. You can choose the perspective you currently work with via the 
symbols on the right end of the toolbar. If you have changed 
the arrangements of views in your perspective and want the original layout back, choose "Window -> Reset Perspective".


<p>
<h3><a name="plugins">Plugins</a></h3>
Bioclipse is completely made up of components called plugins. 
The core of Bioclipse is itself a set of plugins with the most basic 
functionality, standard views, and editors. The rest of the functionality 
is contributed via plugins. For example does the Jmol plugin 
contribute a 3D-visualization based on Jmol, the CDK plugin contributes 
molecular management and analysis using the CDK libraries etc.
This separation is powerful in many ways; A user may 
select to run only the desired plugins and not 
clutter the workbench with unused functionality (like hundreds of menu options), and 
developers also get an ideal framework for plugging in 
their own extensions to Bioclipse and extend the workbench.

<p>
<h3><a name="features">Features</a></h3>
A Feature is a collection of plugins. 
Features mainly serve as units for extending and updating Bioclipse, so when you 
are using <a href="">Software Updates</a> you are downloading features. Some features 
comprise many plugins (like the Cheminformatics plugin), while some only 
contains a single one (like the Drugbank plugin).

<p>
<h3><a name="workspace">Workspace</a></h3>
The Bioclipse Navigator (aka Bioclipse Explorer) points to a special folder on 
the computer called the "Workspace". In the workspace, Bioclipse has control over the 
content and can listen and act on changes to files and folders in real time.
            
The workspace contains a collection of resources. From the user's perspective, 
there are three different types of resources: 
<a href="#projects">projects</a>, folders, and files. There can only be one Workspace open at any time. 
The workspace can be switches (i. e. another folder on the machine can be used as workspace) via File -> Switch Workspace.
            
<p>
<h3><a name="projects">Projects</a></h3>
A project is a collection of any number of files and folders and is 
a container for organizing other resources that relate to a specific area. 
Files and folders are just like files and directories in the file system; 
a folder contains other folders or files and a file contains 
an arbitrary sequence of bytes. 
            
Projects contain files and folders, but not other projects. 
Projects and folders are like directories in a file system.  
When you delete a project, you will be asked whether you want to 
delete all of the files and folders that it contains.  
Deleting a folder from a project will delete the folder and all 
of its children. Deleting a file is analogous to deleting a file in the file system. 

Bioclipse projects are explained further on the <a href="tutorials/navigator.html">Bioclipse Navigator</a> page. 
You can create a new project by choosing the menu <b>File > New... </b>".
In the opened <a href="#wizards">wizard</a>, 
choose "General -> Project", then click Next, then choose a name for the new 
project and press Finish.

<p>
<h3><a name="wizards">Wizards</a></h3>
A wizard is a dialog involving several steps and is used to guide the user 
through actions comprising several steps, for example creating a new 
<a href="#projects">project</a>.
