<h1>Bioclipse concepts</h1>

<p>
<h3><a name="perspectives">Perspectives</a></h3>
Perspectives are collections of editors and views that are grouped into a page on screen, e.g. the Chemoinformatics perspective in Bioclipse displays views and editors for working with molecules. You 
can choose the perspective you currently work with via the symbols on the right end of the toolbar. If you have changed the arrangements of views in 
your perspective and want the original layout back, choose "Window -> Reset Perspective".

<p>
<h3>Views</h3>
In SWT, a View is a window that provides some graphical interface to present something for a user, and might let him interact with it. Examples are the BioResource Navigator, the Jmol View and the properties view.

<p>
<h3><a name="editors">Editors</a></h3>
An Editor is focused on letting the user edit an underlying model and follows the load-save cycle. 
An example is a simple editor for text-files, but could also be more advanced such as a graphical objects editor like the JchemPaint editor.

<p>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
Bioclipse is completely made up of plugins. The core of Bioclipse is itself a set of plugins with the most basic 
functionality, standard views, and editors. The rest of the functionality is contributed via plugins. For example does the bc_jmol plugin 
contribute a 3D-visualization based on Jmol, bc_cdk provides molecular management and analysis using the CDK libraries etc. This means that 
a certain plugin must be installed in order for its functionality to be available for the user. This is powerful in many ways; A user may 
select to run only the desired plugins and not clutter the workbench with unused functionality, and developers have a perfect framework for 
plugging in their own extensions to Bioclipse and not interfere with other.

<p>
<h3><a name="workspace">Workspace</a></h3>
The concept of a workspace is explained in the Help for the <a href="tutorials/navigator.html">navigator</a>. Note you use several directories 
as workspaces in parallel, to switch between them use TODO.

<p>
<h3><a name="projects">Projects</a></h3>
The concept of Bioclipse projects is explained in the Help for the <a href="tutorials/navigator.html">navigator</a>. You can create a new project 
by choosing "File -> New ...". In the <a href="#wizards">wizard</a>, choose "General -> Project", then click Next, then choose a name for the new 
project and press Finish.

<p>
<h3><a name="wizards">Wizards</a></h3>
A wizard is a dialog involving several steps. Wizards are used to guide the user through complex actions, like creating a new <a href="#projects">project</a> or 
doing an NMR prediction.
