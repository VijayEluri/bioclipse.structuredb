<h1>Bioclipse concepts</h1>

<p>
<h3>Perspectives</h3>
Perspectives are collections of editors and views that are grouped into a page on screen, e.g. the Chemoinformatics perspective in Bioclipse displays views and editors for working with molecules.

<p>
<h3>Views</h3>
In SWT, a View is a window that provides some graphical interface to present something for a user, and might let him interact with it. Examples are the BioResource Navigator, the Jmol View and the properties view.

<p>
<h3>Editors</h3>
An Editor is focused on letting the user edit an underlying model and follows the load-save cycle. 
An example is a simple editor for text-files, but could also be more advanced such as a graphical objects editor like the JchemPaint editor.

<p>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
Bioclipse is completely made up of plugins. The core of Bioclipse is itself a set of plugins with the most basic 
functionality, standard views, and editors. The rest of the functionality is contributed via plugins. For example does the bc_jmol plugin 
contribute a 3D-visualization based on Jmol, bc_cdk provides molecular management and analysis using the CDK libraries etc. This means that 
a certain plugin must be installed in order for its functionality to be available for the user. This is powerful in many ways; A user may 
select to run only the desired plugins and not clutter the workbench with unused functionality, and developers have a perfect framework for 
plugging in their own extensions to Bioclipse and not interfere with other.
