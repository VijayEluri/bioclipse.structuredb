The Bioclipse Navigator (A) displays all projects in the workspace and allows for browsing all content. Double-click on a resource to open in an editor. In this example, a CML file with 3D coordinates has been double-clicked, and Bioclipse has opened the file in the JmolEditor (B). Click and hold mouse button while dragging in this editor to rotate molecule. The Outline (C) adapts to the current editor and displays all atoms in the file. Here 4 atoms has been selected in the Outline (hold down shift and click to select multiple entities) and are highlighted in yellow in the Editor (B). The Properties view (D) display properties for, in this case, the  File selected in the Navigator (A). The Perspective Bar (E) allows for switching perspectives. Here the Cemoinformatics perspective is active. The Toolbar (F) displays common tasks for manipulating the files and the open Editor (like save, undo, redo etc). Views can be stacked on top of each other, like in (G) where the Progress view is located behind the Javascript Console. Just click the tab to bring a View to the front. The Javascript Console (G) has an input field (H) where users can enter commands in the Bioclipse Scripting Language (which is based on Javascript). The results of the command is echoed in the Text area above the input field. The lower right corner contains a shortcut bar to access the many introductory resources of the Welcome page (I).

Here, a file containing a molecule with 2D coordinates has been opened in the JChemPaint Editor (B). The Toolbar (C) now contains actions for editing and selecting in the 2D structure. Here, 4 atoms has been selected in the Outline (D) and the corresponding atoms are highlighted in the Editor (B) and properties of the selection are displayed in the Properties View (E). The Javascript Console (F) shows the result of the command “help cdk”, and lists the many commands available from the “cdk” namespace.
