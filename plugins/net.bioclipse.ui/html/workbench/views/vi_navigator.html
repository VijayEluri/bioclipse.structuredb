<h1>The Bioclipse Navigator</h1>

<img src="images/navigator.png" align="right">

<p>
The navigator is the element which allows you to browse your workspace. Roughly speaking, the workspace is a 
designated directory somewhere on your harddisk and the navigator is a file browser (similar to e. g. the Windows 
Explorer). In your workspace, you can have a number of projects. Each project corresponds to a folder in the workspace 
directory. A project can have a hierarchy of folders and files. There can be any files in a project, but typically 
they will be related, e. g. all measurements from experiments on the same sample. Note that not every folder in 
the workspace must be a project, if it is not, it will not be visible, but can be <a href="../../tutorials/importing.html">imported</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to other file browsers, you can expand and collapse projects and folders in the navigator and their contents. 
Files will have an icon indicating the file type (e. g. a chemical structure, a spectrum). If you double click a file, it 
will open in an <a href="../../concepts.html#editor">editor</a>. There might be several editors for a file type, right-click 
and choose "Open with...". Note that the editor you choose will became the default editor for that type, so if you open 
a chemical structure file an a text editor once (default being a graphical editor), you need to use "Open with..." to 
open structure files in the graphical editor again.</p>
<p>The workspace is normally visible on the left in a fresh Bioclipse install. If you cannot see it, go to "Window -> Show View -> Bioclipse Explorer". 
If this does not bring up the navigator, you should <a href="../concepts.html#perspectives">choose the Chemoinformatics perspective and reset this</a>.</p>
