<h1>Editors in Bioclipse</h1>
<p>

An Editor is focused on letting the user edit an underlying model and follows the load-save cycle. 
An example is a simple editor for text-files, but could also be more advanced such as a graphical objects editor like the JchemPaint editor.

<p>
<h2>Common Editor actions</h2>
Right-clicking a Views title bar gives you options to maximize, minimize, close, move etc. 
Doubleclicking the View's title bar is a shortcut to maximize or restore the View.
<br>
All Editors in Bioclipse are hooked up to global actions such as Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Select all, Find etc. 
These are available from the menu option "Edit", or right click from within the editor.


<p> 
<h2>How to open an Editor</h2>
