<h1>Editors in Bioclipse</h1>
<p>

An Editor is focused on letting the user edit an underlying model and follows the load-save cycle. 
An example is a simple editor for text-files, but could also be more advanced such as a graphical objects editor like the JchemPaint editor.

<p>
<h2>Common Editor actions</h2>
Right-clicking a Views title bar gives you options to maximize, minimize, close, move etc. 
Doubleclicking the View's title bar is a shortcut to maximize or restore the View.

<br>
Most Editors in Bioclipse are hooked up to global actions such as Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Select all, Find etc. 
These are available from the main menu, section "Edit", or via right click inside the editor.


<p> 
<h2>How to open an Editor</h2>
There are several ways of doing this:<br>
<ol>
<li>In the Navigator, double-click any Resource that you'd like to edit. The previously used editor will be chosen.
<li>In the Navigator, right-click a Resource and choose option: "Open". This has the same behaviour as double-clicking it.
<li>In the Navigator, right-click a Resource and choose option: "Open with..". and select the type of editor you'd like to use.
</ol>
