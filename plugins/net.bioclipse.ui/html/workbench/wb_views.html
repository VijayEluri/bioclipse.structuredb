<h1>Views in Bioclipse</h1>
<p>

In SWT, a View is a window that provides some graphical interface to present something for a user, and 
lets him interact with it. Examples are the BioResource Navigator, the Jmol View and the properties view.

<p>
<h2>Common View actions</h2>
Right-clicking a Views title bar gives you options to maximize, minimize, close, move etc. 
Doubleclicking the View's title bar is a shortcut to maximize or restore the View.

<p> 
<h2>Open Views</h2>
Not all Views are opened by default, and to see a collection of the available Views, use the menu 
alternative "Window -> Show view..." to get a dialog with the available views.
