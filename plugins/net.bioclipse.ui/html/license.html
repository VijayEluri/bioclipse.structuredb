<h1>Bioclipse licenses</h1>
<br>
<h2>The Bioclipse Platform</h2>
<p>
Bioclipse contains plugins, whose code uses a number of different licenses. The Bioclipse platform, consisting of the bioclipse and com.tools.logging plugins, is licensed EPL. The EPL allows Bioclipse plugins to have other licenses.
The EPL license is available <a href="epl-v10.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>EPL-GPL Statement</h2>

<p>
The GNU Public License (GPL) is a bit special here, and is considered not to be compatible with the EPL. Indeed, a EPL licensed plugin may not use GPL code, which is why the bc_biojava plugin is licensed GPL.
</p>

<p>
Making a GPL project based on EPL code is considered not possible too, while the EPL puts some restrictions on the licensing patents, which are incompatible with the GPL.
</p>

<p>
However, the Bioclipse project considers plugins not to extend the Bioclipse platform, consisting of the bioclipse + com.tools.logging plugins, and are not considered a derivative product, and we hereby approve GPL licensed plugins for Bioclipse.
