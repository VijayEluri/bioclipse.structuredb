<h1>About Bioclipse</h1>


<p>

The Bioclipse project is aimed at creating a Java-based, open source, visual platform 
for chemo- and bioinformatics based on the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rcp">Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP)</a>. 
Bioclipse, as any RCP application, is based on a plugin architecture that inherits 
basic functionality and visual interfaces from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>, such as help system, software 
updates, preferences, cross-platform deployment etc.

<p>To stay updated on upcoming features, releases, new plugins etc, please register for 
the mailing list bioclipse-announce. The development is best followed on the 
Bioclipse Wiki where we document the progress and ideas of the development on a 
daily basis.

<p>Bioclipse is develped as a collaboration between the 
Proteochemometric Group , Dept. of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Uppsala University, Sweden, 
and the Research Group for Molecular Informatics at Cologne University Bioinformatics Center (CUBIC). 

<p>If you would like to contribute to bioclipse; maybe you have some code that you would 
like to integrate or would like to become a developer, 
please see the 
<a href="http://www.bioclipse.net">Bioclipse homepage</a> and the 
<a href="http://wiki.bioclipse.net">Bioclipse wiki</a>




<h2>Literature</h2>
