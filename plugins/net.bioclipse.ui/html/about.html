<h1>About Bioclipse</h1>

<p>
Bioclipse is a complete workbench for life science, including chemo- and bioinformatics 
(e.g. small molecules, sequences, proteins, spectra) and provides 
editing of chemical structures in 2D, interactive visualization of 
chemical structures in 3D, conversion between common file formats in 
life science, various analysis tools and much more - all 
fully integrated into a user-friendly desktop application.
<p>
Bioclipse is a Java-based open source project based on the 
Eclipse Rich Client Platform with its state-of-the-art plugin 
architecture. This gives Bioclipse a huge advantage over other 
systems, as it can easily be extended for adding 
functionality in any direction.

<h2>Licenses</h2>
Bioclipse contains plugins, whose code uses a number of different licenses. The Bioclipse platform, consisting of the core plugins, is licensed as EPL. The EPL allows Bioclipse plugins to have other licenses.
The EPL license is available <a href="epl-v10.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>EPL-GPL Statement</h3>
<p>
The GNU Public License (GPL) is a bit special here, and is considered not to be compatible with the EPL. Indeed, a EPL licensed plugin may not use GPL code, which is why the bc_biojava plugin is licensed GPL.
Making a GPL project based on EPL code is considered not possible too, while the EPL puts some restrictions on the licensing patents, which are incompatible with the GPL.
However, the Bioclipse project considers plugins not to extend the Bioclipse platform, consisting of the bioclipse + com.tools.logging plugins, and are not considered a derivative product, and we hereby approve GPL licensed plugins for Bioclipse.
