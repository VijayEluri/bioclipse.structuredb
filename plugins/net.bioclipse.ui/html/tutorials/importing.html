<h1>Importing data</h1>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="navigator.html">navigator help</a>, only files inside a <a href="../concepts.html#projects">project</a> in the <a href="../concepts.html#workspace">workspace</a> are visible in 
the navigator. Often, you would like to use existing data in Bioclipse. In this case, you need to import them. First <a href="../concepts.html#projects">create an empty project</a> in case you do not yet have a project of which your files should 
become part of. Then choose "File -> Import..." or right click on the <a href="navigator.html">navigator</a> (not on a file or folder) and choose "Import ...". In 
the wizard, choose "General -> File System" and click Next. You can then select files to import and the project to import to. Press Finish and the files will be in the project.</p>
<p>By choosing "General -> Existing Project into Workspace" in the wizard you can also important an existing Bioclipse project in your workspace. The project can either be already in your 
workspace as a directory, but not yet visible, or exist somewhere outside your workspace. This is usefull if you maintain multiple Bioclipse workspaces in parallel (which is possible) or 
you want to exchange complete projects with others, e. g. co-workers.</p>
