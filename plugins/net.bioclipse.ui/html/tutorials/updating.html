<h1>Installing new functionality</h1>
<p>Due to the modular concept of Bioclipse, based on <a href="../concepts.html#plugins">plugins</a> and <a href="../concepts.html#features">features</a>, 
you can easily extend Bioclipse. The best way to do so is by installing features from Update Sites. For this, go to "Help -> Search for new Features" and 
select features you want to install. A number of Update Sites are preinstalled in Bioclipse download, offering a choice of features. Other vendors might 
provide additional features on their own Update Site. You can configure these via "Window -> Preferences -> Update Site".</p>
<p>You can also update the installed features via "Help -> Online Update...". This will install the latest version of all features you 
have installed given there are newer versions.</p>
