<cheatsheet title="General Chemistry Tasks">
	<intro>
		<description>
			This cheat sheet demonstrates general chemistry (or, more strictly speaking, chemoinformatics) tasks you can 
			do in Bioclipse. These are centered around handling molecular data files and calculating molecular properties. 
		</description>
	</intro>
	<item title="Step 0: Prerequisites">
		<description>
 			You need the Chemoinformatics feature installed to run this cheat
sheet to run the first steps. Later steps are optional
and depend on the Speclipse and XMPP features to be installed
too.

       title="Option 1: Draw and Edit single Structures, handle File Formats">
		<description>
			The JChemPaint editor allows graphical viewing and editing of 2D
			diagrams of chemical structures in various formats. You can also
			draw new chemical structures from scratch, and save in CML and
			MDL molfile formats. See help via ? on top of this section for
			details.

       title="Option 2: Handle Multiple Structure Files">
		<description>
			Files with multiple structures (MDL SD files, and SMILES files) are
			handled by the SDF Editor (use ? for details). This editor also
			offers extraction of files (e.g. single files for editing in
			JChemPaint). Creation of new SD files can be performed with
			a New Wizard.

       title="Option 3: Compare molecules">
		<description>
			You can calculate Tanimoto scores to compare the similarity of
			molecules against a reference molecule. See ? for details.

       title="Option 4: Calculate QSAR descriptors">
		<description>
			A wide variety of molecular QSAR descriptors (e.g. XLogP, ALogP,
			Lipinske Rule of Five, Atomic Polarizability) can be calculated in
			Bioclipse using the QSAR feature. See ? for details.

       href="/net.bioclipse.cdk.jchempaint/doc/convert.html"
       title="Option 5: Convert file formats">
		<description>
			In order to convert from one file formats to another (e.g. convert
			a MDL molfile to a CML file), you need to open the file in
			JChemPaint (double-clicking normally does this) and save it via
			File->Save As.. in the new format. The new files must have
			either the .mol or .cml file extension. See ? for details.

       title="Option 6: Create 2D and 3D coordinates">
		<description>
			You can create 2D and 3D coordinates for molecules (either if they
			do not yet exist or if there are already some, which means you do
			a cleanup). Right click on the file and choose "Generate 2D/3D".
			See ? for details.

       href="/net.bioclipse.webservices/doc/wsplugin.html"
       title="Option 8: Search in External databases">
		<description>
			You can search in a variety of external (EBI) databases File -> New -> Web Services -> Use 
			WSDbfetch Web Service at EBI. See ? for details.

       title="Option 9: Work with Spectral Data">
		<description>
			If you want to work with spectral data (e. g. view spectra and peak pick them, do a structure elucidation), you should install 
			the Speclipse feature (in case this is not yet the case) via Help -> Software Update -> Speclipse Update Site and read the General Spectrum Cheat Sheet.
