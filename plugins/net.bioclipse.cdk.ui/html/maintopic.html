<h1>CDK user interface plugin</h1>
<p>This plugin makes available a number of fuctions contained in the <a href="http://cdk.sf.net/">Chemistry Development Kit</a> 
to users of Bioclipse via the graphical user interface. The functions are the following:
<ul><li>2D coordinates generation<br>
For every file containing a molecule, you can generate 2D coordinates via the context menu (right mouse button and choose "Generate 2D coordinates"). These 
will be coordinates optimised to give a clear picture. You are asked if you want to write the coordinates in the existing files (and overwrite existing coordinates) or 
generate a new file with the new coordinates.</li>
<li>3D coordinates generation<br>
For every file containing a molecule, you can generate 3D coordinates via the context menu (right mouse button and choose "Generate 3D coordinates"). These 
will be coordinates showing a likely configuration of the molecule in space. You are asked if you want to write the coordinates in the existing files (and overwrite existing coordinates) or 
generate a new file with the new coordinates. Note the 3D coordinate generation also adds hydrogens to have the molecule fully saturated.</li>
<li>New Molecule from SMILES<br>
This is a wizard available via New -> Chemistry -> Molecule from SMILES, which creates a new CML file containing a molecule you can give as SMILES. The created files can then be used 
for further editing, QSAR calculation etc. This is usefull if you have the SMILES of a structure and want to visualize or work with it.
</ul>
