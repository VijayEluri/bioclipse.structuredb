  <h1>Jmol Editor</h1>

  <p>The Jmol Editor is used to visualize molecules in 3D. It
  requires that the molecule has 3D coordinates to open. When
  opened, a new top menu is available named Jmol.</p>

  <div style="margin:1em;line-height:3em">
    <img src="jmol_editor.png" name="graphics1" border="0" id=
    "graphics1"><br>
    <b>The Jmol editor:</b> <i>Jmol can be used for visualizing
    surfaces of molecules.</i>
  </div>

  <p>Click and hold the left mouse button in the view to rotate the
  protein. Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, or hold down
  SHIFT and click + drag at the same time. To pan around hold down
  SHIFT and doubleklick and drag.</p>

  <p>Clicking atoms toggles selection on and off.</p>

  <h2>Jmol menu</h2>

  <p>The Jmol menu is available when the Jmol editor is open and it
  contains commands for changing the visalization in Jmol</p>

  <h3>Select</h3>

  <p>The select menu contains commands for selecting different
  parts of the visualized molecule.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>

  <p>A couple of different background colors to choose from.</p>

  <h3>Atoms</h3>

  <p>This menu contains actions working on atoms. Spacefill in %
  sets how much big the atoms shoud be drawn.</p>

  <h3>Bonds</h3>

  <p>This menu contains actions working on bonds. Size changes the
  thickness of the bonds.</p>

  <h3>Surface</h3>

  <p>Surface dots can be turned on and off here.</p>

  <h3>Frame</h3>

  <p>These actions have effect on files that contains muliple
  frames</p>

  <h3>Biopolymer</h3>

  <p>The actions in this menu are usefull when working with for
  example proteins.</p>

  <h3>Labels</h3>

  <p>Actions that controls drawing of atom labels</p>

  <h3>Rotate</h3>

  <p>Actions that controls spin of the entire molecule</p>

  <h3>Export as Image</h3>

  <p>Opens a dialog from where the current Jmol visalization can be
  saved to a png file.</p>
