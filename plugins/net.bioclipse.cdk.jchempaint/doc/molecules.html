<h3> Creating Molecules</h3>
<p>In order to start drawing a new molecule, you need to create an empty file by choosing 
New->Chemistry->Molecule. Choose Next and decide where the file containing your molecule 
should go to. The file format will always be CML TODO extension needed? Hit Finish and you then get an empty pane. In order to paint a structure the typical steps would be the following:
<ul><li>Often it is the best to start with rings. Using the ring templates (<img src="../icons/jcp/triangle.png">, <img src="../icons/jcp/square.png">, <img src="../icons/jcp/pentagon.png">, <img src="../icons/jcp/heptagon.png">, <img src="../icons/jcp/hexagon.png">, <img src="../icons/jcp/octagon.png">, <img src="../icons/jcp/benzene.png">) in
the button bar (click on a button and then in the document) you can build the
ring structures of the molecule. You can dock a ring to another ring by clicking
 on an existing ring (the docking atom or bond will be highlighted while hovering over it). If the molecule
has no rings, go to the next step.</li>
<li>The next step are typically the chains. Choose the
<img src="../icons/jcp/bond.png"> button, click on the atom where the chain
starts and then on the last atom of the chain to enlarge it.</li>
<li>After this, you can add double/triple bonds by using
<img src="../icons/jcp/bond.png"> again and clicking on the bonds to make
double or triple. You can use <img src="../icons/jcp/up_bond.png"> and
<img src="../icons/jcp/down_bond.png"> to make existing bonds wedge bonds or
you can draw wedge bonds directly by clicking on an existing bond.</li>
<li>Finally the atoms need to be set. With
 <img src="../icons/jcp/symbol.png"> you can go through some common elements
 by clicking on an atom repeatedly. TODO uncommon elements? With
 <img src="../icons/jcp/plus_one.png"> and
 <img src="../icons/jcp/min_one.png"> you can change the charge.</li>
<li>If you did something wrong accidentally, you can either use Undo/Redo or 
use <img src="../icons/jcp/eraser.png"> to delete atoms/and or bonds.</li>
<li>With <img src="../icons/jcp/move.png"> you can move atoms or bonds to 
improve the visual appearance of the structure. <img src="../icons/jcp/cleanup.png"> 
might be usefulle, since it automatically lays out the structure, set proper bond lenghts, angles etc.</li>
<li><img src="../icons/jcp/lasso.png"> and <img src="../icons/jcp/selectsquare.png"> allow 
you to select atoms and bonds either in free form or in a square. If you use <img src="../icons/jcp/move.png"> 
afterwards you can move whole blocks. TODO anything else possible with selections?</li>
</ul>
Obviously the mentioned steps are only a suggestion.
You can do them in any order. Many functions are also available in context menus
 by right clicking on an atom or bond.</p>
