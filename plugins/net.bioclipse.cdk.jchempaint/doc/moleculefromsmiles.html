<h3> Creating Molecules from SMILES</h3>
<p>You can start a molecule by entering a SMILES, which is an easy way to create the 
structure in many cases. Choose 
New->Chemistry->Molecule from SMILES and choose Next. Enter the SMILES, choose Next and decide where the file containing your molecule 
should go to.  The file format will always be CML TODO extension needed? Hit Finish and you then get your SMILES. You can continue working on it
like <a href="molecules.html">starting from an empty molecule</a>.
