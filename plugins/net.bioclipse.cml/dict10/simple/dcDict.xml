    <entry term="coverage" id="coverage">
        <definition>The extent or scope of the
            content of the resource.</definition>
        <description>Coverage will typically include
            spatial location (a place name or geographic
            coordinates), temporal period (a period label, date, or
            date range) or jurisdiction (such as a named
            administrative entity). Recommended best practice is to
            select a value from a controlled vocabulary (for
            example, the Thesaurus of Geographic Names [TGN]) and
            that, where appropriate, named places or time periods
            be used in preference to numeric identifiers such as
            sets of coordinates or date ranges.

    <entry term="description" id="description">
        <definition>An account of the content of the
            resource.</definition>
        <description>Description may include but is not
            limited to: an abstract, table of contents, reference
            to a graphical representation of content or a free-text
            account of the content.

    <entry term="identifier" id="identifier">
        <definition>An unambiguous reference to the
            resource within a given context.</definition>
        <description>Recommended best practice is to
            identify the resource by means of a string or number
            conforming to a formal identification system. Example
            formal identification systems include the Uniform
            Resource Identifier (URI) (including the Uniform
            Resource Locator (URL)), the Digital Object Identifier
            (DOI) and the International Standard Book Number
            (ISBN).

    <entry term="format" id="format">
        <definition>The physical or digital
            manifestation of the resource.</definition>
        <description>Typically, Format may include the
            media-type or dimensions of the resource. Format may be
            used to determine the software, hardware or other
            equipment needed to display or operate the resource.
            Examples of dimensions include size and duration.
            Recommended best practice is to select a value from a
            controlled vocabulary (for example, the list of
            Internet Media Types [MIME] defining computer media
            formats).

    <entry term="relation" id="relation">
        <definition>A reference to a related
            resource.</definition>
        <description>Recommended best practice is to
            reference the resource by means of a string or number
            conforming to a formal identification system.

    <entry term="rights" id="rights">
        <definition>Information about rights held in
            and over the resource.</definition>
        <description>Typically, a Rights element will
            contain a rights management statement for the resource,
            or reference a service providing such information.
            Rights information often encompasses Intellectual
            Property Rights (IPR), Copyright, and various Property
            Rights. If the Rights element is absent, no assumptions
            can be made about the status of these and other rights
            with respect to the resource.

    <entry term="subject" id="subject">
        <definition>The topic of the content of the
            resource.</definition>
        <description>Typically, a Subject will be
            expressed as keywords, key phrases or classification
            codes that describe a topic of the resource.
            Recommended best practice is to select a value from a
            controlled vocabulary or formal classification
            scheme.

        <description>Type includes terms describing
            general categories, functions, genres, or aggregation
            levels for content. Recommended best practice is to
            select a value from a controlled vocabulary (for
            example, the working draft list of Dublin Core Types
            [DCT1]). To describe the physical or digital
            manifestation of the resource, use the FORMAT
            element.

    <entry term="language" id="language">

            content of the resource.</definition>
        <description>Recommended best practice for the
            values of the Language element is defined by RFC 1766
            [RFC1766] which includes a two-letter Language Code
            (taken from the ISO 639 standard [ISO639]), followed
            optionally, by a two-letter Country Code (taken from
            the ISO 3166 standard [ISO3166]). For example, 'en' for
            English, 'fr' for French, or 'en-uk' for English used
            in the United Kingdom.

            Recommended best practice for encoding the date value
            is defined in a profile of ISO 8601 [W3CDTF] and
            follows the YYYY-MM-DD format.
