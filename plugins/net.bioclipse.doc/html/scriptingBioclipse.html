<h1>Scripting Bioclipse</h1>

<p>Bioclipse 2 contains scripting consoles, one for each supported scripting
language. These consoles give the user access to data and plugins through a
command-oriented environment.

</p><p>Currently supported scripting languages are JavaScript, R, Groovy and
Ruby, although the latter two have been disabled for the 2.0 release.

</p>

<h2> Short Guide </h2>

<p>The JavaScript console takes up the space directly below the editor. It's
open by default in Bioclipse, but should it be closed for some reason, you can
re-open it through <code>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other... &gt; Scripting
&gt; JavaScript Console".
</p>

<p>Try typing in</p>

<pre>2 + 2</pre>

<p>at the console. You should be getting this back:</p>

<pre>&gt; 2 + 2
4</pre>

<p>Now, press the &lt;code&gt;Tab</code> key twice. A list of commands should appear. Try
</p>

<pre>help js</pre>

<p>and you'll get a summary of the <code>js</code>:</p>

<pre>&gt; help js
--
js
--
Controls access to the Javascript Console.

 This manager has the following methods:
clear()
print( String message )
delay( int seconds  )
eval( String command )
say( String message )
executeFile( String filePath )
</pre>

<p>You can also write</p>

<pre>help js.say</pre>

<p>and get this description of the manager method <code>js.say</code>:</p>

<pre>&gt; help js.say
----------------------
js.say(String message)
----------------------
Prints a message to the console, adding a trailing newline.

</pre>

<p>Now, try typing <code>cdk.fromSM</code>, and have the console complete the
method name by hitting the Tab key. The result should be this:</p>

<pre>cdk.fromSMILES(</pre>

<p>You get an opening parenthesis, because this is a method call. If the method expected no parameters, you'd get a closing parenthesis too. But here, let's provide a SMILES string:
</p>

<pre>cdk.fromSMILES("CCCC")</pre>

<p>The result is this:</p>

<pre>&gt; cdk.fromSMILES("CCCC")
CDKMolecule:C4H10
</pre>

<p>If you want to store the molecule for later, you can assign the result to a
variable:</p>

<pre>var butane = cdk.fromSMILES("CCCC")</pre>

<h2> General idea of script support </h2>

<p>Most functionality could be made available to input as scripting commands in
a console. GUIs should merely collect data and call on one/many commands. This
ensures clear separation between code, scripting, and the GUI. This also allows
for recording of screen activities into a script to automate tasks.</p>

<p>The idea is that you are able to work your way towards a final script by
using the GUI. In real research, you don't know where you'll end up from the
start. If you, for example, query a database for something unknown you have no
idea what you expect as results or how many results you will get. If you adjust
your filters iteratively until you get the subset of the results, you end up
with a small sequence of scripting commands, that can serve as one step in your
project/analysis. Then you can look at the problem from a different viewpoint,
maybe a new database. After you find out what information you want from it, you
copy those scripting commands to the script. Now you have data resources that
you can integrate. The point is, with a work-flow system it would not have been
feasible to construct such a work-flow, since it was developed iteratively with
user curation at a number of steps.</p>
