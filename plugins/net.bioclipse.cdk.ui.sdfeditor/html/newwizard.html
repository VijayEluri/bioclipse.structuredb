<h1>The "New SDF" wizard</h1>
<p>This wizard (used via File->New->Chemistry Files->New SDF or right click on a directory and go new etc.) allows you to build an SD file 
with any structures as content. The structures must be in the workspace, but can be in any file format.</p>
<p>On the first page of the wizard, you have to select where the new file should be created and what its name should be 
(if you have no extension, .sdf will be added). On the second page, you can choose the structures to include 
in the file. You can choose structure files directly. If any of these cannot be read, it will be omitted (you 
get these displayed), but the rest will still be added. If you choose the "Include directories recursively" checkbox and 
select any directory, all structure files in these directories and all its sub-directories will also 
be included.</p>
