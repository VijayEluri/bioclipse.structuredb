<h1>Extracting from an SDF</h1>
<p>You can extract a number of entries from an SDF by entry numbers. This function can also be used 
to split an SDF in junks, by extracting one part after the other. To extract, right click on an SDF in 
the navigator and choose "Extract Entries". You need to enter the start entry and the end entry (optional, if none choosen 
one entry will be extracted) and the file to extract to. This will be either a mol file (if one entry) or an SDF 
(if several entries). After you press Finish, the file will be created with your desired entries.</p>
